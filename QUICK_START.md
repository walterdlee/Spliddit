# Spliddit Quick Start Guide

Welcome to Spliddit! This guide will help you get started with splitting bills using our beautiful Liquid Glass interface.

## Getting Started

### 1. Launch the App
When you open Spliddit, you'll see a beautiful welcome screen with:
- 🎨 A glowing receipt icon with Liquid Glass effect
- ✨ Smooth glass animations
- Two main options:
  - **Create New Bill** - Start a new bill splitting session
  - **View Saved Bills** - Access your saved bills (coming soon)

### 2. Create a New Bill

Tap **"Create New Bill"** to start splitting a bill.

## Adding People

### Step 1: Add People to Split With
1. Tap the **"Add Person"** button (with the person+ icon)
2. Enter their name
3. Choose a color for them by tapping one of the color circles
   - Selected colors will have a glowing glass effect
   - Each person gets their own unique color!
4. Tap **"Add"** when done

**Pro Tip**: Different colors help you quickly identify who ordered what!

## Adding Receipt Items

### Step 2: Add Items from Your Receipt
1. Tap the **"Add Item"** button (with the + icon)
2. Enter the item name (e.g., "Burger", "Caesar Salad")
3. Enter the price (just the number, no $ sign needed)
4. Tap **"Add"**

Repeat for all items on your receipt!

## Assigning Items to People

### Step 3: Drag and Drop Magic ✨

This is where the fun begins! Assign items to people using drag and drop:

1. **Long press** on any receipt item
2. **Drag** it up to a person's card
3. Watch the person's card **glow** when you're hovering over it
4. **Drop** the item to assign it

**What happens:**
- The person's card will highlight with their color
- A smooth glass animation plays
- The person's name appears as a tag on the item
- Their total updates automatically!

### Splitting Items Between Multiple People

Want to split an item? Easy!

1. Drag the same item to **multiple people**
2. The item will show everyone it's assigned to
3. The price is **automatically split evenly**
4. Everyone's totals update proportionally

**Example**: A $20 appetizer shared by 4 people = $5 each

## Adding Tax and Tip

### Step 4: Enter Tax and Tip
1. Tap the **edit icon** (pencil) in the Tax & Tip section
2. Enter the tax amount from your receipt
3. Enter the tip amount (or use quick tip buttons for 15%, 18%, 20%, or 25%)
4. Tap **"Done"**

**Smart Distribution**: Tax and tip are automatically distributed proportionally based on what each person ordered!

## Reviewing Totals

### Step 5: Check Who Owes What

The **Summary Section** shows:
- **Subtotal**: Total of all items
- **Total**: Grand total including tax and tip

Each **person card** displays:
- Their name
- Their color
- **Their total** (in green if they owe money)

## Collecting Money via Venmo

### Step 6: Request Payment 💰

1. Tap on any person's card
2. Venmo automatically opens with:
   - Pre-filled amount
   - Note saying "Spliddit: [Bill Name]"
3. Tap to send the payment request!

**Note**: Make sure you have the Venmo app installed!

## Tips and Tricks

### Drag and Drop Tips
- **Long press** firmly to start dragging
- **Hover** over a person to see the highlight effect
- **Drop** the item when you see the glow
- You can **drag the same item to multiple people** to split it

### Visual Cues
- 💙 **Blue glow** = Person is ready to receive an item (during drag)
- 🏷️ **Colored tags** = Show who an item is assigned to
- ✨ **Glass shimmer** = Interactive elements you can tap
- 💚 **Green amount** = Money owed (in person cards)

### Best Practices
1. **Add all people first** - Makes dragging items easier
2. **Add all items before assigning** - Get a complete picture
3. **Double-check tax and tip** - These are distributed proportionally
4. **Use colors wisely** - Similar looking items? Use distinct colors!

## Editing and Removing

### Remove a Person
Currently, you can't remove people after adding them. This is coming in a future update!

### Remove an Item
1. Find the item in the Receipt Items section
2. Tap the **trash icon** 🗑️
3. The item is removed and all totals update

### Unassign an Item
1. Tap the **trash icon** on the item to remove it completely
2. Re-add it if needed
3. (Item-specific unassignment coming in future update)

## Understanding the Liquid Glass Design

### What is Liquid Glass?
Spliddit uses Apple's latest **Liquid Glass design system**, which gives the app:
- ✨ Beautiful blur effects
- 🌊 Fluid animations
- 👆 Interactive responses to touch
- 💎 Modern, premium aesthetic

### Interactive Elements
Elements with Liquid Glass react to your touch:
- **Buttons** - Glow when pressed
- **Cards** - Highlight during drag and drop
- **Color pickers** - Shimmer when selected

This creates a tactile, responsive experience that feels magical! ✨

## Common Scenarios

3. Drag each person's meal to their card
4. Drag shared appetizers to everyone who shared them
5. Add tax and tip
6. Tap each friend to Venmo request

### Scenario 2: Group Brunch
Mix of individual and shared items, plus bottomless mimosas for some.

1. Add everyone
2. Add food items
3. Assign individual meals
4. Split shared items (like the avocado toast everyone picked at)
5. Only assign mimosas to the people who had them
6. Add tax and tip (distributed fairly!)

## Troubleshooting

### "I can't drag items"
- Make sure to **long press** (hold for ~1 second) before dragging
- The item should "lift up" slightly when ready to drag

### "Venmo isn't opening"
- Make sure Venmo is installed
- If not installed, it will open Venmo's website instead
- Check your phone's URL settings

### "The totals look wrong"
- Verify all items are added correctly
- Check that tax and tip are entered accurately
- Remember: Tax and tip are distributed proportionally, not equally!

### "The glass effects aren't showing"
- Liquid Glass requires iOS 17.0+
- Make sure your device meets the minimum requirements
- Some effects may be reduced on older devices for performance
